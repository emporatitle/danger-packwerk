        # We identify two locations associated with this violation.
        # First, we find the reference to the constant within the `package_todo.yml` file.
        # We know that each constant reference can occur only once per `package_todo.yml` file
        # The reason for this is that we know that only one file in the codebase can define a constant, and packwerk's constant_resolver will actually
        # raise if this assumption is not true: https://github.com/Shopify/constant_resolver/blob/e78af0c8d5782b06292c068cfe4176e016c51b34/lib/constant_resolver.rb#L74
        #
        # Second, we find the reference to the specific file that references the constant within the `package_todo.yml` file.
        # This can occur multiple times per `package_todo.yml` file, but we know that the very first reference to the file after the class name key will be the one we care
        # about, so we take the first instance that occurs after the class is listed.
        #
        # Note though that since one constant reference in a `package_todo.yml` can be both a privacy and a dependency violation AND it can occur in many files,
        # we need to group them. That is -- if `MyPrivateConstant` is both a dependency and a privacy violation AND it occurs in 10 files, that would represent 20 violations.
        # Therefore we will group all of those 20 into one message to the user rather than providing 20 messages.

          # is named `MyOtherClass::MyClassThing`. Therefore we include quotes in our match to ensure that we match
          # the constant and only the constant.
          # Right now `packwerk` `package_todo.yml` files typically use double quotes, but sometimes folks linters change this to single quotes.
